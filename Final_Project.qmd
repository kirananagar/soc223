# Data Selection

I think that I am going to need data sets that show:

1.  PL standings since 2000

2.  Squad value/Transfer value since 2000

    1.  Maybe all player data? To also look at age etc?

        1.  This could get too large, but I could filter by GP at a given club in a season \> 5 to solve for this
